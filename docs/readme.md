# Ultimate I3

Ultimate I3 is an open-source 3D Printer design made for those who want the best possible printing quality and build volume. 

The goal of the project is to concentrate the energy of experienced 3D designers and 3D printing hobbyists to create a truly open-source 3D printer design, that can be built with parts easily sourced over the internet. 

The project has core design principles to guide contributions and design decisions. 

 

# Why yet another open source 3D printer project? 

Most consumer-level 3D printers have huge following. Printers like the Creality Ender 3, Tevo Tarantula and others do work great, but their print quality and print volume are limited by construction costs. 

It's not uncommon for users to design parts and add hardware to improve those printers. The result is a huge library of "upgrades", that often don't work together or require the purchase of extra hardware of inconsistent quality or production standards.
